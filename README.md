## Classic Snake

A classic game that everyone in my generation played on their PC or mobile phones. As I continue to learn game development, I want to try and recreate as many of the classic games I played as possible in order sharpen my skills.

I always found that the best way to learn how to build something is to try and recreate it, and that is most certainly true when it comes to games. So far I've completed Breakout, Pong, and now Snake is next on that list.

Purely for the joy of programming and learning, of which, Odin plays a big part in.
